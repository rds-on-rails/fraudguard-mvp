### Method 2: Upload CSV File
**Purpose**: Analyze real transaction data from your organization

**Requirements**:
Your CSV file must contain these exact column names:
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `amount`: Transaction amount (numeric)
- `timestamp`: Date and time of transaction
- `location`: Transaction location
- `device_id`: Device identifier used for transaction

**Steps**:
1. Select "Upload CSV File" radio button
2. Click "Browse files" or drag-and-drop your CSV file
3. System validates the file structure
4. If successful, displays confirmation with record count
5. If columns are missing, shows error message with required fields

**File Format Example**:
```csv
user_id,amount,timestamp,location,device_id
user123,150.50,2024-01-15 10:30:00,New York,device456

## üéØ Fraud Detection Process

### Prerequisites
1. **Model must be trained**: Use "üéØ Auto-Train Model" button
2. **Data must be loaded**: Either generate sample data or upload CSV

### Running Fraud Detection
1. Click "üîç Run Fraud Detection" button (appears in right column)
2. System processes all transactions through the ML model
3. Each transaction receives:
   - **Fraud Flag**: 0 (Normal) or 1 (Suspicious)
   - **Prediction Score**: Numerical score indicating anomaly level
   - **Risk Level**: "High Risk" or "Low Risk" classification
   - **Status**: "Normal" or "Suspicious" text label

### Understanding Results
- **Normal Transactions**: Low prediction scores, typical patterns
- **Suspicious Transactions**: High prediction scores, unusual patterns
- **Prediction Score**: Higher values indicate greater likelihood of fraud
- **Risk Levels**: Based on score thresholds for easy interpretation

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Interpreting Prediction Scores
- **Range**: Typically -0.5 to 0.5
- **Higher Values**: More likely to be fraudulent
- **Lower Values**: More likely to be normal
- **Threshold**: Usually around 0.0 separates normal from suspicious

### Risk Level Classifications
- **High Risk**: Prediction score above threshold, requires immediate attention
- **Low Risk**: Prediction score below threshold, likely legitimate
- **Borderline Cases**: Scores near threshold may need manual review

### Statistical Insights
- **False Positives**: Normal transactions flagged as suspicious
- **False Negatives**: Fraudulent transactions marked as normal
- **Model Accuracy**: Depends on training data quality and feature engineering
- **Continuous Improvement**: Model performance improves with more training data
